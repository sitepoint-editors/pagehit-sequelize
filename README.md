# Working With Databases in Node.js

A page hit counter service which saves data to a MySQL database using the Sequelize ORM.

This is an example project for the purposes of demonstration only. It is not recommended for production use!

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Installation Steps

1. Clone repo
2. Run `docker-compose build`
3. Run `docker-compose up` to launch MongoDB, NGINX, and Node.js development containers.
4. Once started, [load any page](http://localhost:8888/) to test four methods of adding a hit counter:
   * <http://localhost:8888/page-svg.html>
   * <http://localhost:8888/page-jswrite.html>
   * <http://localhost:8888/page-jsdefer.html>
   * <http://localhost:8888/page-jsajax.html>

*If any Docker command fails, run `docker system prune` to remove all stopped containers and dangling images to ensure there are no conflicts with other versions of the page hit counter.*

*If you get an `address already in use` error, the chances are that you already have a MongoDB service running on the port in question. Try stopping the service and re-running the `docker` command.*
